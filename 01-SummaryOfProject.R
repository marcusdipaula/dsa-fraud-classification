#### Personal framework for a systematic approach ####


#___________ FUNDAMENTALS ___________#
#
# 1. Problem statement and comprehension of the context
#     - What am I trying to solve?
#     - Who will benefit of/is asking for this solution?
#     - What would be the ideal scenario for them?
#     - How could I use the available data to help them achieve this scenario?
#     - Why solve this problem? (purpose)
#
# 2. Looking for data: 
#     - Identify entities (and its attributes) of the problem 
#     - Collect data that represents entities
#     - Which hypotheses could I suppose?
#     - Explore the data (superficially) to understand it 
#     - Could I use an algorithm to address the issue or solve it? Which one?



#___________ DATA WRANGLING ___________#
#
# 3. Data preparation and Exploration (Feature Engineering orientated to the 4th and 5th phase)
#     - Is my dataset tidy?
#     - Is my dataset clean?
#     - Which correlations exists between all variables and to the target?
#     - There is any NA in my dataset? If so, how should I treat them? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I narrowing in on observations of interest? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I reduce my variables? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I create new variables that are functions of existing ones? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I binning variables? Which effects would it have?
#     - should I convert variables (categorical = numerical / vv)? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I dummy coding categorical variables? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I standardize numerical variables? Which effects would it have?
#     - Can I test my hypotheses?
#     - 
#
# 4. Building and validating models
#     - Train and test a ML model
#     - Which performance metrics should I relly on?
#     - Iteration



#___________ DEPLOYING ___________#
#
# 5. Deploy
#     - Data StoryTelling
#     - How can I deploy the model to production?
#     - Which strategies should I consider?
#     - An overview of what should be considered:

#### End of framework ####



# 1. Problem statement and comprehension of the context
#     - What am I trying to solve?
#       Predict/prevent potentially fraudulent clicks, characterized by lots of cliks
#       but none installed apps.
#
#     - Who will benefit of/is asking for this solution?
#       The Mobile Advertising Monitoring team, from the TalkingData company.
#       The customers who paid for advertising through mobile marketing campaigns.
#       
#     - What would be the ideal scenario for them?
#       To know, beforehand, who could (has the highest probability of) be a fraud cliker.
#       To pay the right amount for (true) clicks.
#       
#     - How could I use the available data to help them achieve this scenario?
#       By developing visualizations that would help understand what historical data is saying
#       and by creating a predictive machine learning model that could classify each click.
#       
#     - Why solve this problem? (purpose)
#       To help develop a data-driven culture and to show that crime does not pay (lol).
